# Project_100_Days_Of_GRC
100 Days of GRC Challenge – Overview:


Course Structure:

This course is a 100-day challenge in Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC), and it is focused on the progressive development of advanced cybersecurity competencies. It contains:

•	Practical mini projects aimed at constructing a comprehensive GRC portfolio.

•	Strategic foundational work in GRC, facilitating the integration of business principles and technical expertise.





Instructional Approach:

The curriculum is designed to guide learners through the creation of a substantive GRC project named OpenMRS, commencing with the Risk Management Framework. Instruction includes the mapping of controls, risk assessment, and documentation of security plans, with a strong emphasis on applied practice as opposed to theoretical study.




Daily Lessons and Expected Outcomes:

Each day offers a distinct lesson, fostering both practical experience and the development of authentic GRC deliverables. At the course’s conclusion, I will have a completed project suitable for professional presentation, hands-on proficiency in RMF, HIPAA, and FedRAMP, and a heightened level of confidence in applying these frameworks in real-world contexts.
Each posted mini project is part of the larger project.

The course culminates with a Capstone Project which will allow me to showcase what I have learned throughout the course.
