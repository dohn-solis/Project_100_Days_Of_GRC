# Project_100_Days_Of_GRC
100 Days of GRC Challenge – Overview:

Course Structure:

This program constitutes a 100-day challenge in Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC), dedicated to the progressive development of advanced cybersecurity competencies. It contains:
•	Practical projects aimed at constructing a comprehensive GRC portfolio
•	Strategic foundational work in GRC, facilitating the integration of business principles and technical expertise

Instructional Approach:

The curriculum is designed to guide learners through the creation of a substantive GRC project, commencing with the Risk Management Framework. Instruction includes the mapping of controls, risk assessment, and documentation of security plans, with a strong emphasis on applied practice as opposed to theoretical study.

Daily Lessons and Expected Outcomes:

Each day offers a distinct lesson, fostering both practical experience and the development of authentic GRC deliverables. At the course’s conclusion, I will possess a project suitable for professional presentation, hands-on proficiency in RMF, HIPAA, and FedRAMP, and a heightened level of confidence in applying these frameworks in real-world contexts.
Each posted mini project is part of the larger project.
